## `whoami`

Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Fabio, an Italian high school student, and this is my personal blog. 

Here, you'll find me writing about random stuff that I'm passionate about. That spans from tech, programming, robotics and biology all the way to politics and international relations. 

## Contacts

If you want to get in touch, feel free to hit me up on Discord, Telegram or Xitter @fabio53443. If you'd rather send me an email, write at fabio@theseus.codes or fabio53443@gmail.com

That's all for now!
